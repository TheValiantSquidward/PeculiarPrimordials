A strange species of Eocene frogfish, very little is known about the strange and majestic creature known as Neilpeartia Ceratoi.
<NEWLINE>
Neilpeartia is quite the handy fishing buddy to keep around. Left to its own devices, it can collect piles and piles of rare and even some usually non-renewable loot. Of course, you can always decide to kill the poor thing instead. When slain, it drops Raw Neilpeartia, a poisonous food item that can be crafted into Fish Leather. It may also drop a Shed Lure when killed by a dunkleosteus, which alongside some Fish Leather, can be crafted into a new music disc, Lure.
